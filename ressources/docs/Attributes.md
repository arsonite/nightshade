# Attributes

## Ammendable Attributes

**Transcendence**

Transcendence above 25 bestows you with the ability to gain grant by sacrifing health. For aquiring the wisdom needed for Transcendence the Player has to conduct a ritual when breaking said limitation of 25. The higher your Transcendence the more likely it is, that the ritual will succeed, if it doesn´t the Player has to wait a level up to do the ritual again.
Transcendence very strongly increases your grant.

    ++++ Grant

## Lethargy

The final attribute, _Lethargy_, cannot be directly altered and is dependent on the other attributes values.

Lethargy is the only attribute that can´t be manually increased or decreased. It´s an attribute that is dependent on other attributes.
Sometimes you reach your turn more often than the enemies, because the enemies have a higher lethargy than you. This opens up a lot of possibilities.
During fights, the lethargy counter goes up, and every time the counter reaches the manifold of your lethargy, its your turn again. This makes it possible
for you to have multiple consecutive actions during one turn.

When it comes to the values weighing on Lethargy, the factors for the various attributes are the following:
Vigor (++++) - Very strongly increases your lethargy. The heavier and stronger you are, the more slowly you act and the more energy your body needs.
Brilliance (+) - Slightly increases your lethargy. Your higher wit equals a higher risk assessment. This slows down your actions
Empathy (O) - Has no direct effect on your lethargy.
Transcendence (O) - Has no direct effect on your lethargy.
Awareness (--) - Decreases your lethargy. Being aware of your surroundings help you to make quick decisions.
Fitness (--) - Decreases your lethargy. Self-explanatory.
Alacrity (---) - Strongly decreases your lethargy. Your agility directly influences your ability to act.

## Status Attributes

These are attributes that are influenced by buffs, debuffs, status-effects and ammendable attributes themselves.

**Maximum Health**

There are three factors determining your ability to withstand blows. Health, blood and armor (both natural and artificial).

Arguably the most important of these are your maximum hitpoints, which determine how much damage you can endure before you die. Your maximum health is also dependent on the amount of blood in your body.

    Placeholder

**Maximum Stamina**

The amount of maximum endurance before your character exhausts his/her ability to strike and flee. Subsequent actions consume health instead of stamina.

    Placeholder

**Maximum Focus**

**Maximum Grant**

The amount of magical ability before you character loses his/her ability to conjure.

**Decency**

Describes how people around you perceive you.
Decency is affected by your appearance and what your character wears. Wearing less clothes increases the allure or disgust people have towards you, which is dependent on your looks and gender and the opposing peoples political and religious views.

Muscular men are gazed upon by some women and sometimes even men and increases chances of charm, while obese, smelly men will trigger repulsiveness in both genders.

Some people might perceive you as indecent, with some people calling you a pervert as a man and some people calling you a whore as a woman.

Women have additional dangers in this harsh world when they're perceived as dressing indecent.
The range of danger begins with with lesser acts like being catcalled, which has some negative effects on sensitive minds and ends with the most abhorrent crimes like sexual abuse.

Most perculiar women will be able to fend off perverts and the likes, but powerful people will be able to force themselves upon you.
