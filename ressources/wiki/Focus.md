# Focus

_Focus_ is the physical force that is projected from your mental strength. Even with your puny body at limits, _Focus_ allows you to go all out once during a battle, overwhelming your enemy with tremendous force and speed or protecting you from fatal damage.

There are 4 _Focus_ paths and since they are coupled with your mind, also somewhat affect your mental being and vice versa. Once you choose a _Focus_ path, there is no turning back.

You arenÂ´t restricted from being and using anything. But your _Focus_ will immensily support a very specific way
your character evolves and fights.

_Focus_ is the one gameplay element that is all about fighting and weapons, while skills are overall skills for your character.

Before you gain any _Focus_ at all, which is unlocked at _LVL_ 15, your only attack options are simple singular strikes that drain little _Stamina_ and have no effect on _Lethargy_.
With _Focus_ attacks, most moves drain a lot _Stamina_ and either increase or decrease your current _Lethargy_.

_Focus_ abilities can be active and passive, but all _Focus_ abilities need a certain treshold of _Focus_ percentage aquired during battle. All your _Focus_ is lost after the battle is over and needs to be aquired during fights again.

There are four _Focus_ paths your character can take:

## Armored Armadillo

    The Focus path of defense.

## Galvanizing Gorilla

    The Focus path of unarmed combat.

## Seething Snake

    The Focus path of armed combat.

## Harrowing Hawk

    The Focus path of ranged combat.

Impact Force (+1/+2/+3/+4/+5/+6/+7/+8/+9/+10)

High Impact Force (+1/+2/+3/+4/+5/+6/+7/+8/+9/+10)
Requires: Impact Force +10
Your punches (and if unlocked kicks) bear such a force behind them, that there is a 5/10/15/20/25/30/35/40/45/50% chance that the knockback is so strong, it sends the enemy flying. When an object is in the trajectory of the flight and the object is not destroyed in the process, it inflicts additional damage on the target. When it breaks it still inflicts damage, just not as great.

Cleaving Greater Impact Force (+1/+2/+3/+4/+5/+6/+7/+8/+9/+10)
Requires: High Impact Force +10

Allows the user to wear a weapon of his choice (except heavy weapons) in his mouth. This increases the number of attacks per round to 3. Wearing a weapon in your mouth increases your lethargy by 1.
