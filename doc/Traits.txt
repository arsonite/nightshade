/* This is the documentation for the asset 'Trait' */

Traits are either automatically trough trigger-events or manually acquired features, manipulating certain statistics in either non-playable or playable characters.

Traits are passive whereas skills are active and have to be used in exchange to different statistics. Traits trigger by themselves.

Traits are upgradable by spending a certain number of experience points, instead of leveling attributes. By upgrading Traits, certain stats are either increased
or decreased. The level of a trait, is depicted by a number and an attribute.

Some Traits can be picked by spending experience-points. Some are acquired by random or events. The acquired ones can be either positive or negative.
Negative traits can be downgraded to lessen the effect of the negative buff.
