# Focus

_Focus_ is the physical force that is projected from your mental strength. Even with your puny body at limits, _Focus_ allows you to go all out once during a battle, overwhelming your enemy with tremendous force and speed or protecting you from fatal damage.

There are 4 _Focus_ paths and since they are coupled with your mind, also somewhat affect your mental being and vice versa. Once you choose a _Focus_ path, there is no turning back.

You arenÂ´t restricted from being and using anything. But your _Focus_ will immensily support a very specific way
your character evolves and fights.

_Focus_ is the one gameplay element that is all about fighting and weapons, while skills are overall skills for your character.

Before you gain any _Focus_ at all, which is unlocked at LVL 15, your only attack options are simple singular strikes that drain little _Stamina_ and have no effect on _Lethargy_.
With _Focus_ attacks, most moves drain a lot _Stamina_ and either increase or decrease your current _Lethargy_.

_Focus_ attacks always drain percentages of Stamina and _Focus_, but the more you have as value maximums, they more effective _Focus_ attacks become.

_Focus_ abilities can be active and passive, but all _Focus_ abilities need a certain treshold of _Focus_ percentage aquired during battle. All your _Focus_ is lost after the battle is over and needs to be aquired during fights again.

There are four _Focus_ paths your character can take:

## Armored Armadillo

    The Focus path of defense.

## Galvanizing Gorilla

    The Focus path of unarmed combat.

## Seething Snake

    The Focus path of armed combat.

## Harrowing Hawk

    The Focus path of ranged combat.
