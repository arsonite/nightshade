# Traits

All characters have _Traits_, but only characters with the _Perculiar_-trait can aquire additional ones willingly.

_Traits_ are either aquired automatically, similar to buffs through trigger-events or manually manipulating certain statistics in either non-playable or playable characters.

The difference between _Traits_, _Skills_ and certain _Focus_ abilities, is that _Traits_ are entirely passive.

But _Traits_ can, similar to _Skills_ and _Focus_ ability, still be upgraded by spending a certain number of ascension points, instead of leveling attributes. By upgrading certain _Traits_, certain stats are can be also either increased or decreased.

While selected _Traits_ have always positive effects, aquirable _Traits_ can be either positive or negative.
Negative _Traits_ can be downgraded to lessen the effect of the negative buff.

Unlike _buffs_, _debuffs_ and _Status_-effects, _Traits_ are permanent.

_Traits_ can be upgraded through the following path:

    1. Higher
    2. Greater
    3. Grand
    4. Prime
    5. Inhuman (only in survival mode)
    6. Godlike (only in hardcore mode)
