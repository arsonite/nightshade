High Impact Force (+1/+2/+3/+4/+5/+6/+7/+8/+9/+10)
Requires: Impact Force +10
Your punches (and if unlocked kicks) bear such a force behind them, that there is a 5/10/15/20/25/30/35/40/45/50% chance that the knockback is so strong, it sends the enemy flying. When an object is in the trajectory of the flight and the object is not destroyed in the process, it inflicts additional damage on the target. When it breaks it still inflicts damage, just not as great.

Strong Neck
Allows the user to wear a weapon of his choice (except heavy weapons) in his mouth. This increases the number of attacks per round to 3. Wearing a weapon in your mouth increases your lethargy by 1. Strong neck also allows the user to automatically repel one random attack per fight, which afterwards temporarily increases your lethargy by another 1, until the fight ends.
