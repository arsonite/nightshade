/* This is the documentation for the asset 'Focus' */

The Focus is the path your character walks on. You aren't restricted from being and using anything. But your focus will immensily support a specific way
your character evolves.

Your focus meter can be filled once a battle. Long hard battles charge a focus meter fully, allowing to you perform a focus attack, an incredibly powerful attack than can finish your enemy off.
