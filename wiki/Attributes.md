/* This is the documentation for the asset 'Attributes' */

Every character in this game posses certain Attributes.
The Attributes are:
	Fitness
	Vigor
	Alacrity
	Brilliance
	Awareness
	Empathy
	Transcendence

Lethargy is the only attribute that can't be manually increased or decreased. It's an attribute that is dependent on other attributes.
Sometimes you reach your turn more often than the enemies, because the enemies have a higher lethargy than you. This opens up a lot of possibilities.
During fights, the lethargy counter goes up, and every time the counter reaches the manifold of your lethargy, its your turn again. This makes it possible
for you to have multiple consecutive actions during one fight turn.

When it comes to the values weighing on Lethargy, the factors for the various attributes are the following:
    Vigor (++++) - Very strongly increases your lethargy. The heavier and stronger you are, the more slowly you act and the more energy your body needs.
    Brilliance (+) - Slightly increases your lethargy. Your higher wit equals a higher risk assessment. This slows down your actions
    Empathy (O) - Has no direct effect on your lethargy.
    Transcendence (O) - Has no direct effect on your lethargy.
    Awareness (--) - Decreases your lethargy. Being aware of your surroundings help you to make quick decisions.
    Fitness (--) - Decreases your lethargy. Self-explanatory.
    Alacrity (---) - Strongly decreases your lethargy. Your agility directly influences your ability to act.
